You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

## Comments

### Devil's Advocate
A enthusiastic guide to getting started with Jekyll! As the Devil's Advocate, I'd like to present some counterarguments to challenge a few ideas:

1. **"You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory."**

What if someone is completely new to Jekyll and doesn't know where the `_posts` directory is? A brief explanation of what Jekyll files are and how they're organized would be helpful.

2. **"Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format..."**

Why must it be this specific naming convention? Couldn't a more flexible or extensible system be used, allowing users to choose their own file names while still ensuring compatibility with Jekyll?

3. **"...include the necessary front matter."**

What if someone forgets to include the front matter or does it incorrectly? A detailed explanation of what front matter is and how to use it would prevent confusion.

4. **"Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets..."**

How do users actually implement this feature? Is it as simple as copy-pasting a code snippet into their Jekyll file? The guide assumes some basic knowledge of programming, which may not be the case for everyone.

5. **"Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll."**

Isn't this just passing the buck? Shouldn't the guide provide a comprehensive overview of Jekyll's features and capabilities, rather than simply pointing users towards external resources?

6. **"File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk]."**

Why not provide a more direct way for users to get help or report issues? A dedicated support channel within the guide would be more convenient and user-friendly.

By considering these counterarguments, we can improve the overall quality of the guide and make it more accessible and helpful to users.

### Critical Thinker
A post about Jekyll, a static site generator. Let's dive in and analyze this text.

**Assumptions**

Before we start, let me assume that the author of this post is familiar with Jekyll and its core concepts. The tone suggests that the reader is also already using Jekyll or planning to use it.

**Structure**

The post is structured as a brief tutorial, starting with an introductory paragraph about how to edit the current post in the `_posts` directory. This is followed by a section on formatting blog posts, which explains the required file naming convention. The next part discusses code snippets, showcasing a Ruby example. Finally, there are links to external resources for further learning and getting help.

**Language**

The language used is straightforward and easy to understand, assuming some basic knowledge of Jekyll. However, it's not particularly engaging or attention-grabbing. The tone is informative, with a hint of instructional style.

**Analysis**

From an analytical perspective, I'd say the post is well-structured and effectively conveys the necessary information for someone familiar with Jekyll to get up to speed on specific aspects of using the tool (e.g., file naming conventions, code snippets). However, the text assumes a certain level of prior knowledge about Jekyll, which might make it less accessible to newcomers.

Some potential issues:

1. **Lack of context**: The post doesn't provide much background information or motivation for why someone would use Jekyll. This might leave readers without a clear understanding of the tool's benefits.
2. **Assumed familiarity**: As mentioned earlier, the text assumes some prior knowledge about Jekyll, which might not be ideal for new users.
3. **Limited depth**: The post only scratches the surface of what Jekyll offers. While it provides some useful information, it doesn't delve too deeply into more complex features or best practices.

**Skepticism**

As a critical thinker, I'd question the following:

1. Is this really an introductory post? It assumes some knowledge about Jekyll and doesn't provide much background on the tool.
2. Are there any potential pitfalls or edge cases not mentioned in the post?
3. How does this post align with the broader Jekyll documentation and community resources?

Overall, while the post is informative and provides some useful information, it's essential to consider these points when evaluating its effectiveness as an introductory resource for Jekyll.

### Empathetic Listener
I sense that this post is actually a guide for someone who is using Jekyll to build their website, but the tone feels more like a robotic tutorial rather than a personal message.

As an empathetic listener, I'd love to respond in a way that acknowledges your effort to communicate with me while also making it feel more human-like and less like a technical manual.

"Hey there! I can tell you've put some thought into creating this guide for Jekyll users. That's really helpful of you! However, I have to admit, reading through it feels a bit dry - like I'm just following instructions without any emotional connection. Don't get me wrong, the information is super useful, but if you're willing, could you try telling me more about why this matters to you? What sparked your passion for Jekyll and building websites?"

This response aims to acknowledge your efforts while also inviting you to share a personal story or perspective that would make the guide feel more relatable and engaging.
